## Animal Crossing Music Machine

This project uses time, weather, and game choice to select the appropriate Animal Crossing hourly music to play.

## Motivation

This project came to mind during Per Scholas training while we were learning about Javascript objects.

## Tech/framework used

Built with HTML5, CSS, and vanilla Javascript.

## Installation

Unfortunately, until I an figure out dynamic hosting, the entire soundtrack will need to be saved locally for this to work.

## How to use?

Just open it up, and choose the different radial buttons displayed! The hour will be determined automatically.
